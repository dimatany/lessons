                <h2>Introduction</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="block">Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking
        for environment setup instructions, they've moved to <span class="underline">their own section</span>.
        Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation, Native
        Components, React, and more!</p>
            <div class="headings-block">
                <p>2</p>
                <h2>Core Components</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="block">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
        applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles.
        With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs
        as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using
        React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn
        more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
        components work in React Native.</p>
            <div class="headings-block">
                <p>3</p>
                <h2>React Fundamentals</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="block">React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular open source library for
        building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of
        React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
        can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
            <p class="block2">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
            <p class="block2"><span class="bolder">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses
        cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures
        that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
            <p class="block2"><span class="bolder">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets
        you write elements inside JavaScript like so:<span class="emphasis">
        &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;.</span> The React docs have
        <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more.
        Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it.
        Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding
        it with curly braces inside <span class="emphasis">&lt;Text&gt;.</span></p>
            <p class="block2"><span class="bolder">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
            <p class="block2"><span class="bolder">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
        how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage.
        State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes
        from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>
            <div class="headings-block">
                <p>4</p>
                <h2>Handling Text Input</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="block">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
        It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called
        every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
        takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
            <p class="block2">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
        their words into a different language. In this new language, every
        single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob"
        would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
